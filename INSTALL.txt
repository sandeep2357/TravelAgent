DGT Newz about this release
===========================

This release is labeled *Custom* because some of it has been recoded in order to get it fully functioning and more practical to use. The original release required (15) directories to be CHMODED to 777, (Our release requires only 2). There were also some coding errors repaired and minor security improvements added.

Because we have made so many template structure changes, you will not be able to use any developer released themes if they are ever released. It is much easier to find the required template files for customization in this release though.
